# ACC Data App

## Preamble

As an aspiring data analyst, I wanted to find a way of extracting useful data from the sim to help me make proper data-driven decisions; this project is my attempt at doing just that.

## Current State and Objectives

Currently - and by some miracle at that - the code in it's current state works pretty much how I wanted it to! Despite this, I'm convinced the code could be improved considerably, hopefully to make it easier to see some real-time (or at least close to real-time) data as well as it's CSV-logging for post-session analysis. 

## Thanks
Directly and indirectly, these people have made this script possible. Thank you.
